# Yeddit - Reddit subs to YouTube utility

Made with SvelteKit. Takes a subreddit, filters out YT links and autoplays vidoes.
Handy if you want to listen to all new music posted on a subreddit, but don't want to tab back
and forth to go the next track.

# Running

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

# NOTE
Very much a work in progress (not much work right now), so expect bugs.
